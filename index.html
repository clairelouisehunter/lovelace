  <h1> The Creator Of The First Algorithm </h1>
<h2> Ada, Countess of Lovelace </h2>
  <h4> 
   <p> Ada Lovelace, daughter of <strong>Lord Byron</strong> was an english mathematician who is most known for her work with <strong>Charles Babbage</strong>.<br>
    Ada was steered away from the "Dangerous Poetic Tendencies", or about anything that resembled her father.<br>
    Her mother got her to be tutored in math and music, which was odd back then for a female to get special education.<br> 
    Ada Lovelace met Charles Babbage when she was <em>17</em> and he was <em>42</em>, and they found that they both had an extreme insterest for eachother.<br>
    Though the two had a large age gap when they met, they were both intellectual peers.<br>
     When Ada was married her and Babbage still did mathematical work together through letters. </p>

  <h2> What Ava Invented </h2>
  <h4><p>Ada Lovelace created the <em>first</em> computer algorithm.
  Ada was to translate <em>Luigi Menabrea</em>, a young Italian engineer's notes into english.
    She then extended the paper with her <em>own</em> notes, which were added to the translation.
    Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G.
    In note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine. 
    It is considered the <em><strong>first</strong></em> published algorithm ever <em>specifically</em> created for implementation on a computer.
    The engine was never completed so her program was <em>never</em> tested.
    </p></h4>
  
  <h4><p> Ada Lovelace helped inspire mathematicians <em>hundreds</em> of years after her time.<br>
    <em>Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace</em> is a <strong>brilliant</strong> women, who should be remembered. </p>
