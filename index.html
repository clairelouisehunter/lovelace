<h2> Ada, Countess of Lovelace </h2>
  <h4> 
   <p> Ada Lovelace, daughter of <strong>Lord Byron</strong> was an english mathematician who is most known for her work with <strong>Charles Babbage</strong>.<br>
    Ada was steered away from the "Dangerous Poetic Tendencies", or about anything that resembled her father.<br>
    Her mother got her to be tutored in math and music, which was odd back then for a female to get special education.<br> 
    Ada Lovelace met Charles Babbage when she was <em>17</em> and he was <em>42</em>, and they found that they both had an extreme insterest for eachother.<br>
    Though the two had a large age gap when they met, they were both intellectual peers.<br>
     When Ada was married her and Babbage still did mathematical work together through letters. </p>
