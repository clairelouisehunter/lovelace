<h2> Ada, Countess of Lovelace </h2>
  <h4> 
   <p> Ada Lovelace, daughter of <strong>Lord Byron</strong> was an english mathematician who is most known for her work with <strong>Charles Babbage</strong>.
    Ada was steered away from the "Dangerous Poetic Tendencies", or about anything that resembled her father.
    Her mother got her to be tutored in math and music, which was odd back then for a female to get special education. 
    Ada Lovelace met Charles Babbage when she was <em>17</em> and he was <em>42</em>, and they found that they both had an extreme insterest for eachother.
    Though the two had a large age gap when they met, they were both intellectual peers. 
     When Ada was married her and Babbage still did mathematical work together through letters. </p>
